**Pair Programming TDD** - Write tests first; let them fail; fix them!

This exercise is good for both new and experienced developers.

New developers can learn how to code from TDD (that's an extra), and experienced developers can practice one golden rule on testing: baby steps.

Surprisingly, new developers, the less experienced ones use to provide more great ideas than experienced developers.

## Tower of Hanoi

### Rules

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
